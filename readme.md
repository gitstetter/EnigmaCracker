# De(s)cription
This is a python package for enrypting messages with the historic enigma machine.
I spent quite some time trying to find a suitable existing project and ended up implementing it myself.

This library answers the question no one asked:

> _"How can I annoy my surroundings by sending them trivial encrypted messages and make them go through the process of deciphering?"_

No dependecies to other python packages necessary to decrypt messages and free for use and further adaption (MIT license).

Includes a rudimental gui via tkinter.

# Usage
```
from enigma import *
```
